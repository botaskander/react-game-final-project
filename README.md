## Simple Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple tic tac toe app built with React and Javascript for a coding challenge. It uses the Minimax Algorithm to run the computer AI which is essentially a search of a tree of possible outcomes of a game, finding the most optimal move that lets the computer win in the least number of moves.

[Minimax Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)

There are a ton of comments in the actual code to better help you along through the process (especially `findBestMove` if you're looking for the algorithm) of understanding what was done here and why.

To load this locally, you can simply `git clone` the repository, and then run `npm install` and then `npm run start` to see the code running on `http://localhost:4000/`.

Alternatively, it's also available [HERE](https://tictactoe-6a18f.web.app/), running on the web using firebase.

Thanks for taking a look!
